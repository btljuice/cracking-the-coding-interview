Listen
  - to every element in the question. Some hints lie within the question
  - If your brute force does not use certain element of the question, it might
    be a road to optimization
- Draw, talk aloud, etc.
Example
Brute Force
Optimize
  - Look for any unused information.
  - Use a fresh example.
    - Look at the corner case.
    - Look at the base case.
    - Look at a complex enough.
  - If you find an incorrect solution, can you work from there to correct it?
  - What to optimize : space and/or time
Walkthrough

Try
Opt 1.
    BUD
    Bottleneck
    - Optimize where needed in the O(...)
    Unnecessary Work
    Duplicated Work
Opt 2.
    Do it Yourself : Solve the problem manually and self-reflect on what your
    brain did exactly
Opt 3.
    Simplify and Generalize
Opt 4.
    Bottom-up approach : Base Case and build
Opt 5.
    Data Structure Brainstorm (try every structure possible for the problem at hand)
Opt 6.
    Best Conceivable Runtime as a lower bound to O()
